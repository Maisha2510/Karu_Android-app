# Executive Summary:
KARU is an android application, which is used to display and sell art works of artists irrespective of their gender and other narrow considerations in Bangladesh. Artists can register online for being a member of the art gallery and each artist can upload a digital copy of their artwork / or a picture of their work under the respective categories. They can post their artwork for a fixed price. The artist is liable to pay a fraction of the price of each artwork to the application owner to manage the running fund for the app. Art lovers have to go to the art exhibition to collect their favorite art or paintings. But nowadays they are not getting enough time to go to the galleries and collect art and paintings. In this application, customers can also register online and they can browse artworks that are arranged in different categories. Each Customer can create their own gallery to see his favorite artwork without much difficulty. And each user has the right to purchase artwork using the integrated payment gateway. The paintings will be delivered as per the order.


## Introduction
### a.	Project Introduction

Karu is a marketplace to discover, buy and sell fine art, photographs & crafts in Bangladesh where customers will be able to look for and purchase numerous paintings, crafts, and photographs through this online art gallery project, which is an automated setup where consumers may purchase various artworks. It is dedicated to connecting collectors to in-demand artworks by today’s leading artists & freelancers. With Karu, you can collect/buy art from galleries in Bangladesh and sell artworks from your collection. From this platform, users can also purchase art exhibitions, and music concert tickets, and Organizers can also host their events through this app. Additionally, users can also get news and stay updated about the art world.

## Background of the Study
### a.	Project Background
The four of us are much interested in art and thus we wanted to put our knowledge of this field into our Information System Design project.
Karu app will help you create and share your own art or discover the work of others, from peers to art historical masters. Customers do not have to physically go to a store and wait for asking about a certain product. One-click of a button will open a world of amazing artwork for them. Customers can browse their favorite categories of products and buy them directly online via means of online currency (bkash, bank account, visa/Mastercard, etc.) without having to deposit cash. Some unique features like a refund, custom modification, etc. will give people ease of shopping.

## Objectives:
### a.	Primary Objective:
This application allows users to search for their favorite artworks as well as place orders. The end-user can also obtain information about the art category and related descriptions.
Karu Art Gallery provides you with the chance to see online art exhibitions. In our app, we provide you with information on all previous and upcoming art exhibitions. The Online Art Gallery is updated on a daily basis, allowing users to browse and purchase the most up-to-date collection of modern & classic artwork s from Bangladesh.
### b.	Secondary Objectives:
Artists will be able to showcase their talent all over the country and earn money by selling their works from the comfort of their own homes, through this app. It will increase their confidence and productivity. An emerging set of art dealers are now specializing in work available only online, and could see their art in our virtual Gallery. It gives artists even more exposure and allows them to be contacted by prospective buyers.

Answer: Yes, I think it can. 
8. Do you think our app can help you to overcome those challenges? 
Answer: Online art shops can help us by selling at the actual price, without manipulating, and within a very short time, because if we go out for selling our artworks in a shop it costs much and also wastes a huge amount of time. So, I expect online art shops will work for the betterment of artists day to day life.


### 2.	Planning
#### a. Project Planning:
- First and foremost, we will improve communication and create a single point of contact for project developers.
- The next step will be to determine who will undertake which particular responsibilities, as well as when and how those jobs will be completed.
- Facilitating project management and control as the project proceeds
- Will enable effective project monitoring and control
- We will collect relevant feedback

#### c.	Project Estimation:
Our project is set to be finished at the end of the semester which will be the 12th week. But we will try and see that the time
doesn’t cross more than 14th weeks.
#### d.	Project Budget:
The estimated Budget is 250000 BDT. Will try to not exceed this budget.
#### e.	Cost-benefit Analysis:
|   |   | Year 0  | Year 1  | Year 2  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Revenue  |   |  0 |0   |0   |
| Cost  | Hardware  |98000   | 35750  | 7250  |
|   |  Software |4500   | 4000  | 1500  |
|   | Maintenance  | 35600  |  16400 | 9500  |
|   |  Total |  138100 | 56150  | 18250  |
|  Cash Flow| | - 138100 |- 56150  | -18250  |   

    Net Present Value (NPV):
    CF = Cash Flow, R = Rate of risk, t = time NPV = ∑ CF/(1+R)^t

    For Year 0:
    PV = CF/(1+R)^t = - 138100 /(1+0.12)^0 = –138100
    For Year 1:
    PV = CF/(1+R)^t = - 56150 /(1+0.12)^1 = –50133.928
    For Year 2:
    PV = CF/(1+R)^t = - 18250 /(1+0.12)^2 = –14548.788
    So,
    NPV = ∑ CF/(1+R)^t = (–138100 –50133.928 –14548.788) = –248514
  
As we can see the result is negative as we have not made any revenue at the start. But as our users come and they start purchasing using the app we will start getting our revenue. We can get revenue too when others do their advertisement in our app.

#### f.	Risk Analysis:
The only source of money for our apps’ business is the sale of art, and the first year's revenue is unknown. People are more comfortable making purchases online through websites like eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, and other social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, which increases competition among artists.
